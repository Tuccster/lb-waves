 A multiplayer wave-based shooter.
 
# Code
All the custom code that I wrote for this project can be found in 'Assets > Scripts'
 
# Story
 The idea behind this game is that you're a sceientist in a robotics testing facility, where all kinds of ridiculous robots are created, made to do humanities most undesirebly tasks. One day, the robots had enough and retaliate, and the game is you and friends fighting your way out of the factory.

# Multiplayer with Photon
This is the first time I've attempted to create a game with using the [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) multiplayer framework, so the implemenation is rather rough.

# Where this project currently sits
I spent months on this project, learning Photon and figuring out how I wanted to structure it. The game doesn't have much in terms of gameplay outside of joining a lobby and shooting at some boxes, but I learned a lot from it.
